Hi, Welcome to my profile!
My name is Jo√£o Correia and i'm a computer engineer.
My academic path ended in 2024 with a computer engineering degree,
Before that i atended a programming course that was equivalent to secondary school and had a duration of 3 years.
I have already done 2 internship of 3 and 4 months and my main function on both was web developer using Ionic, Html, Css, Php and Google Firebase.
On a student and personal context i have some knowledge on C#, Python and MySql with design and connection of databses.

This will work as a personal portfolio with mainly personal projects.

Enjoy! :)
